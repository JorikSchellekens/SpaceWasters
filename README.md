# SPACE WASTERS s.k.a. Invaders of boredom.

Kaboom them before they pew you. I'm proud of the colors. Vibrant, vibrant, colors.

# About
This game was made as an assignment for Trinity College Dublin during my first
year as an undergraduate there (2016-2017). It's also an homage to the games I 
never got to play while growing up.
